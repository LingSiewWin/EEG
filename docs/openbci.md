OpenBCI Hardware Testing Report
Date: September 20, 2025
Goal: Test if our OpenBCI device works for the project
Problem Summary
We needed to check if our OpenBCI brain-computer interface gives real brain data or fake sample data. Testing revealed the device has a hardware communication failure.
What We Tested
Software Setup: Downloaded and installed OpenBCI GUI v6.0.0-beta.1
Hardware: OpenBCI Cyton board + USB dongle (both power on with blue LEDs)
Tests Performed:

Synthetic data test - worked perfectly (confirmed software is functional)
Hardware connection test - failed completely

Key Findings
What Works:

Computer detects USB dongle correctly
Both devices power on properly
Software runs fine with fake data

What Doesn't Work:

OpenBCI board won't communicate with computer
All connection attempts fail
Auto-scan through all radio channels fails

Console Log Evidence
The software error log shows repeated failures:

Error reading from Serial/COM port (50+ times)
BOARD_NOT_READY_ERROR
Board completely unresponsive to all commands

Diagnosis: The board's internal radio system is not working. This is hardware failure, not a setup problem.
Project Impact
Current Status: Cannot get any data from the OpenBCI device
Blocker: Need working hardware before we can continue with the project
